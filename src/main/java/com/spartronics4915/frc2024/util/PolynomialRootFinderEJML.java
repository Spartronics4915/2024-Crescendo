/**
  * <p>
  * Eigenvalue decomposition can be used to find the roots in a polynomial by constructing the
  * so called companion matrix.  While faster techniques do exist for root finding, this is
  * one of the most stable and probably the easiest to implement.
  * </p>
  *
  * <p>
  * Because the companion matrix is not symmetric a generalized eigenvalue decomposition is needed.
  * The roots of the polynomial may also be complex.  Complex eigenvalues is the only instance in
  * which EJML supports complex arithmetic.  Depending on the application one might need to check
  * to see if the eigenvalues are real or complex.
